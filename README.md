## About the Project

Project Odin is designed to help aspiring web developers build a solid foundation in web development technologies. The repository contains a range of projects that cover:
- **HTML & CSS:** Building responsive and semantic web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Implementing interactive functionalities.
- **Back-End Development:** Learning server-side logic with Node.js, Express, and related tools.
- **Version Control:** Managing project history using Git and GitHub.

The goal is to create a modular, well-structured codebase that can be expanded with additional features over time.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For markup and styling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For dynamic functionalities and logic.
- **Node.js & Express:** For server-side programming (if applicable).
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and code collaboration.
- **Optional Libraries/Frameworks:** (e.g., React, Vue, or Bootstrap) if you decide to integrate them.
